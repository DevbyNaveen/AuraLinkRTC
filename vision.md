### AI and Advanced Integrations
- **AI-Powered Enhancements**: Integrate voice transcription (via OpenAI Whisper), sentiment analysis, and automated moderation to create smarter meetings.
- **Voice Assistants and Bots**: Add programmable backend participants for real-time AI interactions, such as chatbots, auto-summarization, or Q&A during calls.
- **Spatial Audio and Immersive Experiences**: Support for 3D audio, AR/VR integrations, and IoT sensor data (e.g., motion-triggered video alerts).
- **Recording and Streaming**: Record sessions in MP4/HLS formats, stream to platforms like YouTube/Twitch, or export tracks for on-demand playback.

### Developer-Friendly Tools
- **RESTful APIs and WebSockets**: Simple token-based authentication with JWT for room creation, participant management, and webhooks.
- **CLI and Management Dashboard**: Command-line tools for testing and a web UI for API key management, analytics, and monitoring.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extensible architecture with plugins for custom codecs (VP9, AV1), moderation, and third-party integrations.
